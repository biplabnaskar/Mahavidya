        "origin": "In the sixth century Devi Mahatmyam, Kali is shown as Maha Kali in the 1st chapter. She is born from the sleeping body of God Vishnu as Goddess Yog Nidra, to wake him up to protect Brahma and the world from the 2 demons Madhu and Kaitabha. Once Vishnu woke up, he started a long war against those demons but they were still undefeated and gloating in their success. Seeing this, Maha Kali took the form of Maha Maya and went to enchant the 2 demons. When they were distracted by Maha Maya, Vishnu killed them instantly.\n\nIn the later chapters, Chand and Mund were 2 demons who attack Goddess Durga. Durga responds with such ferocity that Kali emerges from her forehead and kills them both. Here, Kali is described as having dark blue skin, a gaunt face with sunken eyes, and wearing a tiger skin cloth with a garland of skulls.\n\nLater in the same battle, the demon Raktabij, whose generals were Chand and Mund, faces Kali in battle. Raktabij has a boon that every drop of his blood that touches the ground will produce another of his clone. Since Durga is unable to defeat Raktabij with countless of his clones, Kali sucks his blood out of his body and devours his clones to defeat them.\n\nIn Linga Puran, the history of Kali Maa begins with Shiva asking Parvati’s help in defeating the demon Daruka, who was granted the boon that only a female could kill him. Parvati creates her form of Kali and goes on to defeat Daruka and his enemies.\n\nIn both cases of Raktabij and Daruka, Kali is described as being drunk on bloodlust after defeating the enemies and her craving for bloodlust gets out of control. Shiva has to intervene by laying calm on the floor. When Kali is marching in anger, she accidentally lays a foot on Shiva and her tongue rolls out. She immediately calms down and merges with Durga/Parvati again.\n\nIn another story, Shiva teases Parvati by calling her Kali (dark-skinned) after she participated in a war. Parvati is greatly offended and begins to perform austerity for ages until she loses her dark complexion, sheds it, and becomes Gauri, the golden-skinned goddess. Her shed dark sheath becomes Kaushiki, who when enraged becomes Kali.",

This form is generally not worshipped by householders; rather, it is worshipped by Tantrics and sanyasis. Shamshan Kali imparts the knowledge of death and liberates individuals from the cycle of birth and death. Worshipping Shamshan Kali is for those who seek to renounce worldly attachments and attain emancipation. She is considered the most dangerous incarnation.\n\nDakshin Kali of Dakshineshwar is one of the most famous peethas of Maa Kali, located in Kalighat near Kolkata, where Ramkrishna Paramhans used to worship. This form of Kali is benevolent, appearing like a mother with four hands. The gracious presence of the mother in Dakshineshwar is believed to alleviate all pains. The name 'Dakshin Kali' originates from Yama, the lord of death, who comes from the south (dakshin). Upon hearing the name of Kali, Yama fled, which led to the mother Goddess being called Dakshin Kali.\n\nBhadrakali signifies the gentle form of Kali. After all the destruction and drinking of the blood of demons, the mother Goddess placed her leg on the chest of Mahadev. To pacify her, Mahadev lay down on the ground. This pacified form of Kali, when she is at peace and calm, is called Bhadrakali. This majestic and graceful form of Kali is adorned with gold jewelry and has a mild smile on her face.\n\nKrishna Kali is a lesser-known form of Kali, primarily worshipped in Bengal. This form is an amalgamation of Shri Krishna and Kali. Since Krishna is also dark-skinned and, in his form as Vishnu, calls Parvati his sister, both Krishna and Kali are considered a brother-sister duo who are dark-skinned in this form.\n\nMaa Kali appears in many subtler forms, which are mostly worshipped by Tantrics and are not typically for householders. Kali transcends the material dimension, making it challenging to understand every nuance of her forms. Kali holds significance in various major and minor traditions across Bharat (India), and she is important in every sampradaya (sect). The different subtler forms of Maa Kali include Chintamani Kali, Adya Kali, Kamakala Kali (relating to the skeleton), Guhya Kali, Hamsa Kali, and Kalasankarshini Kali.",

The nine Tārās are as follows: The Green Tārā, residing at the center of the mandala, has one head and two arms, making the gesture of granting boons (varada) with one hand and holding a blue utpala flower with the other.

        "origin": "Tara, the Buddhist saviour-goddess with numerous forms, is widely popular in Nepal, Tibet, and Mongolia. She is the feminine counterpart of the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara. According to popular belief, she came into existence from a tear of Avalokiteshvara, which fell to the ground and formed a lake. Out of its waters rose a lotus, which, on opening, revealed the goddess. Like Avalokiteshvara, she is a compassionate deity who helps individuals 'cross to the other shore.' She is the protectress of navigation and earthly travel, as well as spiritual travel along the path to enlightenment.\n\nIn Tibet, White Tara (Sanskrit: Sitatara; Tibetan: Sgrol-dkar) is believed to be incarnate in every pious woman. She symbolizes purity and is often represented standing at the right hand of her consort, Avalokiteshvara, or seated with legs crossed, holding a full-blown lotus. She is generally shown with a third eye and sometimes with eyes on the soles of her feet and the palms of her hands (then known as 'Tara of the Seven Eyes,' a form popular in Mongolia).\n\nThe Green Tara (Sanskrit: Shyamatara; Tibetan: Sgrol-ljang) was believed to be incarnated as the Nepali princess. She is considered by some to be the original Tara and is the female consort of Amoghasiddhi, one of the 'self-born' buddhas. She is generally shown seated on a lotus throne with her right leg hanging down, wearing the ornaments of a bodhisattva, and holding a closed blue lotus (utpala).\n\nThe White and Green Taras, with their contrasting symbols of the full-blown and closed lotus, represent the unending compassion of the deity who labours both day and night to relieve suffering. Under the influence of Tibetan Buddhism, the different forms of Tara have multiplied to a traditional 108. Tibetan temple banners frequently show 21 different Taras, coloured white, red, and yellow, grouped around a central Green Tara. The figure of the 'self-born' Amitabha Buddha is often shown in her headdress, as she, like Avalokiteshvara, is considered to be an emanation of Amitabha.\n\nIn her ferocious, blue form, invoked to destroy enemies, she is known as Ugra-Tara, or Ekajata. As a red goddess of love, she is Kurukulla. As a protectress against snakebite, she is Janguli. The yellow Bhrikuti is an angry Tara with frowning brows.",
        "description": "In the northern schools of Buddhism, the traditional pantheon of deities is predominantly male. At the center is Shakyamuni Buddha, a man who attained spiritual perfection about 2,500 years ago. In Tantric traditions of the Himalayas, there are the Five Dhyani-Buddhas or Five Tathagatas—Vairocana, Amoghasiddhi, Amitabha, Ratnasambhava, and Akshobhya—all manifestations of the Buddha's teachings and spiritual powers, and all male. Bodhisattvas, compassionate beings who have postponed their own enlightenment to assist others, are also generally male, though Avalokiteshvara, the most revered bodhisattva, can assume a female form. Additionally, there are arhats, Kings of Light, wrathful deities, and various lesser divinities, mostly male, often depicted with female consorts. Despite the male dominance, Tara stands out as a supremely powerful female deity in the Buddhist pantheon. Her name means 'star' in Sanskrit, symbolizing her role as a guide on the spiritual path. In some northern Buddhist traditions, Tara is considered a bodhisattva and is often depicted as the female consort of Avalokiteshvara. Legends suggest she was born from Avalokiteshvara's tears of compassion or that she was a devout princess who, after millions of years of meditation, vowed to be reborn in female form to continue helping others, thus manifesting her enlightenment as the goddess Tara.In the Himalayan region, particularly in Tibet and Nepal, Tara is regarded more as a supreme goddess or female Buddha rather than merely a bodhisattva. She is honored with titles such as the Wisdom Goddess, the Embodiment of Perfected Wisdom, the Goddess of Universal Compassion, and the Mother of all Buddhas. Reflecting her immense power and compassion, Tara is often depicted in paintings and sculptures seated on a lotus throne in a regal yet solicitous pose. This pose, known as the 'pose of royal ease' or lalitasana, is commonly adopted by bodhisattvas like Avalokiteshvara, Manjushri, and Maitreya. Typically, this position involves sitting in a lotus position with the right leg either hanging down over the edge of the lotus or bent with the foot flat on the ground. In Tara's depiction, her right foot is usually positioned on a smaller lotus, signifying her readiness to act swiftly and assist her followers when needed, rather than simply relaxing.In Himalayan representations, Tara can manifest in up to 21 different forms, with paintings and pieced-silk images often depicting her in five distinct colors, similar to the Five Dhyani-Buddhas. The most common forms are Green Tara and White Tara, named after legendary princesses from Chinese and Nepalese traditions respectively. Green Tara, associated with enlightened activity and active compassion, is considered the source from which all her other forms emanate. In Leslie Rinchen-Wongmo's pieced-silk thangka, Green Tara is depicted seated on a lotus throne, holding lotuses—a trait she shares with Avalokiteshvara. Her lotus is typically the blue or night lotus (Skt: utpala), known for releasing its fragrance with the appearance of the moon. Thus, Tara is connected not only with stars but also with the moon and night. As Green Tara, she is also linked to fertility and the growth and nourishment of plants, flowers, and trees.White Tara is linked with maternal compassion and healing. In many depictions, she is shown with eyes in the palms of her hands, on the soles of her feet, and in the center of her forehead, symbolizing her ability to perceive those in suffering and offer aid. The pieced-silk thangka mentioned earlier clearly shows these eyes in her palms, as she holds her right palm outward to grant the wishes of her followers. White Tara is particularly associated with practices focused on extending one’s lifespan to continue practicing the Dharma and advancing further on the path to spiritual fulfillment.With her numerous attributes, Tara offers significant inspiration to female Buddhists. Historically, female practitioners were often taught that to achieve enlightenment, they needed to be reborn as males to progress toward full spiritual liberation. The presence of Tara in the Buddhist pantheon, both as a bodhisattva and as a female Buddha, has provided a sense of inclusivity and hope for spiritual salvation to many female practitioners. Sculptures such as the elegant 18th or 19th-century bronze figure from Nepal, which embodies the serenity of perfected wisdom and the grace of true compassion, are among the world's most exquisite and powerful representations of female spirituality.",

        "origin": "Goddess Tripura Sundari is strong and powerful, dominating within Tantric Hinduism which has steered in the direction of feminine theology-based schools and cults. She is connected to the Trika schools where the Sati trinity of the supreme energy is present in the triple patterns of Tripura Sundari. She is renowned by several different names across numerous texts and stories. One of the most popular narratives discussing Tripura Sundar’s many forms is Lalitasahasranama, depicting over a thousand of her identities and spiritual characteristics. The Lalitasahasranama text talks about many Goddesses of the Mahadevi, all of which proclaim their own claim to some divine Shakti (power).From an etymological point of view, ‘tri’ refers to Three and ‘Pura’ suggests a city or citadel. Therefore, Tripura could be interpreted as ‘the one constituting all three citadels’, denoting the three worlds or enormous spheres of God’s creation: the physical world, the astral world and the causal world. Another meaning of Tripura is believed to be the ‘Three States of Consciousness. Thus, the ‘Tripura Sundar’ is literally translated as ‘She who is gorgeous in the three states of consciousness.",

Another meaning of Tripura is believed to be the ‘Three States of Consciousness. Thus, the ‘Tripura Sundar’ is literally translated as ‘She who is gorgeous in the three states of consciousness.After Lord Shiva came to know that his wife Sati killed herself, he was beside himself with sorrow, grief, and anger. As a result, Lord Shiva beheaded his father-in-law. After his wrath lessened, he let Daksha be resurrected with the head of a goat. After the death of his wife Sati, a depressed Lord Shiva entered into deep penance. Sati was reborn as Parvati, daughter of mountain king Himavat and his wife – the apsara Mena. This was possible due to a boon that was granted to them by Adi Parashakti (Highest form of Shakti). This is why Parvati pursued and was able to get Lord Shiva as her husband.Once the Devas had to combat their enemy Tarakasura. This demon was bestowed with a boon that he could only be slain by the son of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. In order to beget a son from the deities, the Devas sent Kamadeva, the God of Love. He shot his flower arrows at Shiva and Parvati to bring out ‘feelings of love’ within them.Angered that he had been deceived, Lord Shiva opened his third eye and destroyed the God of Love, and reduced him to ashes. The wife of Kamadeva – Goddess Rati as well the Devas appealed to Lord Shiva to revive Kamadeva. After paying attention to their plea, Shiva gazed at the ashes of the God of Love.From the ashes arose Bhandasura, who caused havoc in the universe and ruled from the city named Shonitha Pura, after which he began harassing the Devas. The celestial demi-gods requested Sage Narada’s counsel and the Trimurti, who recommended them to take the aid of Nirguna Brahman – the ultimate godhead.In order for the universe to benefit, a Maha Yagna (great sacrifice) was performed, where the entire creation i.e., the manifest universe was presented as the oblation and from the fire emerged Maha Tripura Sundari (Saguna Brahman).Tripura Sundari then split herself into Kameswara (Purush) and Kameshwari (Prakriti) and redesigned the entire universe as it seemed to be before. In another legend, Goddess Parvati wanted to charm and captivate Lord Shiva so badly that she changed herself into Lalita Tripura Sundari to demonstrate her beauty and omnipresence in the three worlds.",

            "Bhuvaneshwari Devi is a deeply revered and significant figure in Hinduism, especially within the tantric and Shakta traditions. As the Goddess of the Universe, she embodies the cosmic principles that govern creation, preservation, and dissolution. Her presence is not only powerful but also deeply nurturing, reflecting her role as the divine mother of all beings. Bhuvaneshwari’s form is majestic and awe-inspiring, yet it also exudes a sense of warmth and compassion. Her divine body is described as resplendent and radiant, often depicted with a golden or reddish hue, symbolizing the vibrant energy that permeates the universe. This radiant glow reflects her connection to the life-giving forces of the cosmos, the light that sustains all creation. Her face is serene and beautiful, often compared to the full moon in its luminosity. The moon, which is closely associated with her, signifies the mind, emotions, and the cyclical nature of life. Her eyes are wide and expressive, symbolizing her all-seeing nature and her ability to perceive the past, present, and future. They are often depicted as large, almond-shaped, and filled with a divine compassion that encompasses all living beings. Bhuvaneshwari Devi's hair is usually depicted as long, flowing, and dark, cascading down her back and shoulders. It represents the infinite nature of time and space, enveloping the entire universe. Sometimes, she is shown with a crown or headdress adorned with jewels and symbols of divinity, signifying her supreme status as the queen of the cosmos. The crown also reflects her role as the ruler of all worlds and her authority over the forces of nature. Her attire is equally symbolic, emphasizing her divine and universal nature. Bhuvaneshwari is usually adorned in richly colored garments, often in shades of red, orange, or gold. These colors represent the dynamic energy of the universe, the fire of creation, and the vitality of life. The garments are often depicted as flowing and graceful, emphasizing her feminine form and her role as the nurturing mother. She is adorned with exquisite jewelry, including necklaces, earrings, bracelets, and anklets, all made of gold and precious gems. These ornaments not only enhance her beauty but also symbolize her role as the giver of wealth, prosperity, and abundance to her devotees. The jewelry she wears is not merely decorative but carries deep symbolic meanings related to the cosmic elements and the forces she controls. Around her neck, Bhuvaneshwari Devi wears a garland of flowers, often lotus or hibiscus, both of which are sacred in Hinduism. The lotus, in particular, is a powerful symbol of purity, enlightenment, and spiritual growth, rising from the mud to bloom in the light. This garland represents her connection to the divine and her ability to uplift her devotees from the mundane to the spiritual realm. Her four hands are significant, each carrying symbolic items that represent her divine powers and responsibilities. In one hand, she holds a noose (pasha), a tool used to bind and control, symbolizing her power to restrain and guide the mind and senses. In another hand, she holds a goad (ankusha), which is used to prod or drive, signifying her ability to direct her devotees towards the path of righteousness and spiritual awakening. Her other two hands are often depicted in mudras, or symbolic gestures. One hand is raised in the abhaya mudra, a gesture of protection, assuring her devotees that they are safe under her care. The other hand is in the varada mudra, a gesture of blessing, granting boons and fulfilling the desires of those who seek her blessings. Bhuvaneshwari Devi is often depicted seated on a lotus, further emphasizing her connection to purity, creation, and spiritual enlightenment. The lotus seat also signifies her detachment from the material world, even as she governs and nurtures it. This posture reflects her transcendence over the physical realm, while also being intimately connected to it. In some depictions, she is surrounded by a halo or aura, symbolizing her divine light that illuminates the universe. This light is a reminder of her omnipresence and the ever-present divine energy that sustains all life. Her presence is both a source of comfort and a reminder of the vast, unfathomable power that she wields. Bhuvaneshwari Devi’s worship is believed to confer numerous benefits, both spiritual and material. Devotees turn to her for protection, guidance, and the fulfillment of their desires. She is revered not only as a powerful deity but also as a compassionate mother who cares for all beings with unconditional love. Her image and form are deeply symbolic, encapsulating the profound truths of the universe and the divine principles that govern life. Through her worship, devotees seek to connect with these principles, to align themselves with the cosmic order, and to receive the blessings of the Goddess who holds the universe in her embrace."
